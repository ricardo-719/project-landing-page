# project-landing-page
This is a project to create a landing page from scratch.

For this project we'll be using basic HTML and CSS code.

For documentation I'll be describing my step by step procedure on this page:

1. Use Git to clone the repository using command "git clone <ssh link>"
2. Command touch core files index.html and  style.css
3. Input HTML boilerplate
4. Look at the requirements and plan ahead: -Concept: Improve your sitting meditation course  -HTML: will have 6 sections 
5. Start with the header, from top section to bottom. Create divs for each section considering the planned design
6. Create "intro", 2nd section
7. Create "info", 3rd section
8. Create "quote", 4th section
9. Create "call-to-action", 5th section
10. Create "footer", 6th and final section
